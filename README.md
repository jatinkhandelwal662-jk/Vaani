# 🏛️ Delhi Sudarshan - AI Civic Redressal System

**"Proactive Governance. Instant Redressal. Zero Latency."**

Delhi Sudarshan is a Next-Gen Civic Grievance System powered by **Google Gemini Multimodal AI**. It replaces traditional IVR systems with **"Vaani"**, a hyper-realistic AI officer that talks to citizens, detects emergencies, and performs surprise audits on government officials.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🗣️ 1. AI Officer "Vaani" (Gemini Live API)
- **Zero-Latency Voice AI:** Converses naturally in **Hindi & English**.
- **Context Aware:** Understands complex complaints like "My street light is sparking" vs "It is just off".
- **Critical Safety Protocol:** Instantly detects emergencies (Transform Sparking, Open Manhole, Roads collapsed, Main Pipeline burst) and triggers a **Red Alert** on the dashboard.

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. The "Surprise Audit" System (Twilio Integration)
- **Automated Verification:** The system calls citizens automatically to verify if work claimed as "Solved" was actually done.
- **Corruption Check:** If a citizen denies the fix on the call (pressing '2'), the system flags the official for corruption immediately.

### ⚡ 3. Emergency Triage & Prioritization
- **Smart Sorting:** Complaints are not sorted by date, but by **severity**.
- **Visual Alarms:** Dangerous issues (e.g., "Open Manhole") are highlighted in **RED** with blinking badges for immediate attention.

### 📜 4. Accountability Protocol
- **Proactive Updates:** The AI refuses manual status checks to discourage "chasing" the government. Instead, it promises automated outbound calls when issues are resolved, shifting accountability to the state.
